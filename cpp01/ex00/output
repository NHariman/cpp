Welcome to The Main!
~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~~@~
Here are some Ponies to get started:

You just adopted a connemara named Booboo!
Booboo has a white coloured mane and blue eyes.
Booboo's coat is a glossy white and Booboo weighs 50kg and is 130cm tall.


Booboo is a pony from The Stack, you'll go there later to meet other Stack ponies.
You just adopted a new forest named Apple!
Apple has a black coloured mane and brown eyes.
Apple's coat is a glossy black and Apple weighs 56kg and is 115cm tall.


Apple is a pony from The Heap, you'll go there later to meet other Heap ponies.

The Main ranch has both stack and heap ponies living together. Booboo and Apple get along very well together!

Let's go to the other ranch to see where Apple came from.

Welcome to The Heap!

Your Main pony had to stay home so, here's a pony from The Heap you can borrow:

You just adopted a dartmore named Baby!
Baby has a black coloured mane and brown eyes.
Baby's coat is a glossy black and Baby weighs 56kg and is 145cm tall.


Let's do some stuff on The Heap!
You combed Baby's black mane.
You pet Baby's black glossy coat.
Baby weighs 56kg of pure Pony Power. And stands 145cm tall like the majestic steed they are.
You wonder if there are other dartmore's out there, but surely yours is the best.



It's time to go! Say goodbye to Baby!
Oh no! Baby died :(

:( sorry to hear the pony you befriended at The Heap died.

Let's not dwell on such sad things through, we still have to visit The Stack to see where Booboo came from.

You just adopted a shetland named Honey!

:( I heard the Stack pony you befriended died as well! There must be some weird pony killing virus going around. You better go home and process the grief of losing two ponies you loved.

Why don't you say goodbye to our Main ponies before you go though!

Let's say goodbye to Apple first. You always have to say goodbye to Stack ponies before you say goodbye to Heap ponies.
Oh no! Apple died :(

OH NO!!

Well... at least we still have one pony left..
Oh no! Booboo died :(
